Introduction:

This README provides an overview and instructions for using the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing tool, which combines data harvesting from YouTube with data storage in SQL and MongoDB databases. The tool also includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for data exploration and visualization. It is important to adhere to legal and ethical guidelines while using this tool and comply with YouTube's terms of service.


Prerequisites:

1.Python (version 3.7 or above) installed on your system.

2.Required Python libraries (listed in the "requirements.txt" file).

3.YouTube API key obtained from the Google Developers Console (https://console.developers.google.com/).

4.SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and MongoDB installed and configured on your system.

5.Streamlit library installed (use pip install streamlit).


Installation:

1.Clone or download the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing repository from GitHub (https://github.com/yourrepository).

2.Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

3.Copy code

4.pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration:

1'Obtain a YouTube API key from the Google Developers Console by creating a new project and enabling the YouTube Data API v3.

2.Copy the API key and place it in the appropriate configuration file (e.g., config.py or settings.py) within the downloaded repository.

3.Configure the SQL database connection by providing the necessary details (e.g., host, port, username, password) in the configuration file.

4.Configure the MongoDB connection by providing the necessary details (e.g., host, port) in the configuration file.


Usage:

Launch the tool by running the Streamlit application script (e.g., app.py) using the following command:

1.arduino

2.copy code

3.streamlit run app.py

4.The Streamlit application will start and open in your default web browser. You can interact with the web interface to perform various actions, such as data harvesting, data storage, and data exploration.

5.Use the provided input fields and buttons in the Streamlit web interface to specify your data collection parameters, such as search keywords, channels, or specific videos. The tool will use the YouTube API to fetch the requested data and store it in the SQL and MongoDB databases.

5.The harvested data will be saved in the respective databases according to the configured settings. The Streamlit application provides options to explore and visualize the stored data.
